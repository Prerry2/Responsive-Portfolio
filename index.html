      <p>My name is Alex Perry, and I am a web developer from the Cleveland area. I graduated from Gilmour Academy in 2012. I always have enjoyed playing video games, which led me to desiring to learn how they are made. Web development seems an odd step for learning that, even to me, but I knew that this would give me not only the tools needed to produce a game, but also the way of thinking needed for console game development. I only recently started learning to code, but I have plenty of experience with learning how to use various software. I am adept at researching solutions to programming problems using the internet. I recently finished attending a six-month coding bootcamp at Case Western Reserve University for learning the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack, and look forward to utilising the skills, knowledge, and experience from the course in future work.</p>
